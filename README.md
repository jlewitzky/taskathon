# Welcome to the Task-a-Thon: A Game to Help Students with Time Management!

As educational curriculums become more advanced and competitive, many students find themselves juggling classes and several assignments all at once, as well as time for meals, sleep, and relaxation. 

My proposed solution is an online board game that gathers information from the user about their tasks for the day (or week) and configures them into a path similar to those of Candy Land or Life, and the userâ€™s goal is to have their game piece make it to the finish point by completing every task.

This design targets elementary through graduate school students who have trouble staying focused; any person who attends classes and has assigned work outside of school hours but struggles with motivation.

The combination of wanting to provide students with an entertaining resource to help them achieve greater academic success and encouraging healthier lifestyles is what inspired me to tackle this problem.
